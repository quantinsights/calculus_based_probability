If in $n$ identical trails, $A$ occurs $\\nu$ times, and if $n$ is very large, then $\\nu/n$ should be near the probability of $A$. Clearly, a formal mathematical theory can never refer directly to real life, but it should atleast provie theoretical counterparts to the phenomena, which it tries to explain. Accordingly, we require that the vague introductory remark be made precise in the form a theorem. For this purpose we translate *identical trials* as *Bernoulli trials* with probability $p$ for success. If $S_n$ is the number of successes in $n$ trials, then $S_n/n$ is the average number of successes and should be near $p$. It is now easy to give a precise meaning to this.

We have here a special case of the remarkable fact that there exist a few distributions of great universaility that occur in a surprisingly large variety of problems.

We shall now indicate by many physical experiments and statistical observations actually lead to such an interpretation of (16).

Each event is represented by a point on the time axis, and we are concerned with chance distributions of points. There exists many different types of such distributions, but their study belongs to the domain of continuous probabilities which we have postponed to the second volume. Here, we shall be content to show that the simplest physical assumptions lead to $p(k;\\lambda)$ as the probability of finding exactly $k$ points (events) within a fixed interval of specified length. Our methods are necessarily crude, and we shall return to the same problem with more adequate methods in chapter XVII.\n",

Either a particular subinterval is empty or it contains atleast one of our random points(or events) and we agree to call the two possibilities failure and success, respectively.

Because, when a bin is assigned its first ball, that counts as a success, any subsequent placement of balls into this bin are technically failures. \n",

Otherwise, we have the same assumptions as before: (1) If $t$ is small, the probability of finding more than one point in a domain of volume $t$ is small as compared to $t$; (2) non-overlapping domains are mutually independent. To find the probability that a domain of volume $t$ contains exactly $k$ random points, we subdivide it into $n$ subdomains and approximate the required probability of $k$ successes in $n$ trials.

When he wants a match, he selects a pocket at random, the successive choices thus constituting Bernoulli trials with $p=\\frac{1}{2}$. Suppose that initially each box contained exactly $N$  matches and consider the moment when, for the first time, our mathematician discovers that a box is empty. At that moment the other box may contain $0,1,2,\\ldots,N$ matches and we denote the corresponding probabilities by $u_r$ Let us identify success with the choice of the left pocket. The left pocket will be found empty at a moment when the right pocket contains exactly $r$ matches, if and only if, $N-r$ failures precede the $(N+1)$st success. The probability of this event is $f(N-r;N+1,\\frac{1}{2})$. The same argument applies to the right pocket and therefore the required probability is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "u_r = 2f(N-r;N+1,\\frac{1}{2}) ={{2N - r} \\choose {N-r}}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2N-r} = {{2N - r} \\choose {N}}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2N-r}  \\tag{29}\n",
