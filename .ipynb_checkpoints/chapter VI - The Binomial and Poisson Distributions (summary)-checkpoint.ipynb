The sample space of $n$ Bernoulli trials contains $2^n$ points or successions of $n$ symbols $S$ and $F$, each point representing one possible outcome of the compound experiment. Since the trials are independent, the probabilities multiply. In other words, *the probability of any specified sequence is the product obtained on replacing the symbols $S$ and $F$ by $p$ and $q$* respectively.

The number of successes can be $0,1,2\\ldots,n$ and our first problem is to determine the corresponding probabilities. Now, the event $n$ trials result in $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures can happen in as many ways as $k$ letters $S$ can be distributed among $n$ places. In other words, our event contains ${n \\choose k}$ points, and, by definition, each point has the probability $p^k q^{n-k}$. This proves the\n",
