    "Continuous random variables contrast starkly with discrete random variables in that $P(X=x)=0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbf{R}$; this may seem paradoxical since $X$ necessarily takes some value. Very roughly speaking the resolution of this paradox lies in the observation that there uncountably many possible values for $X$, this number is so large, that the probability of taking any particular value cannot exceed zero. \n",

    "*The numerical value $f(x)$ is not a probability*. However, we can think of $f(x)dx$ as an element of probability $P(x \\leq X \\leq x + dx)$. It is the probability that $X$ falls in an infinitesimally small interval of length $dx$. "
