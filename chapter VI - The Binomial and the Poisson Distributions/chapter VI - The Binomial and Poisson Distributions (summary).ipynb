    "Repeated independent trials are called Bernoulli trials if there are only two possible outcomes for each trial and their probabilities remain the same throughout the trials. It is usual to denote the two probabilities by $p$ and $q$, and to refer to the outcome with probability $p$ as success, $S$, and to the other as failure, $F$. Clearly, $p$ and $q$ must be non-negative and \n",

The sample space of $n$ Bernoulli trials contains $2^n$ points or successions of $n$ symbols $S$ and $F$, each point representing one possible outcome of the compound experiment. Since the trials are independent, the probabilities multiply. In other words, *the probability of any specified sequence is the product obtained on replacing the symbols $S$ and $F$ by $p$ and $q$* respectively.  Thus, $P\\{SSFSF \\ldots FFS\\} = ppqpq\\ldots qqp$."

    "Frequently, we are interested only in the total number of successes produced in a succession of $n$ Bernoulli trials but not in their order. The number of successes can be $0,1,2\\ldots,n$ and our first problem is to determine the corresponding probabilities. Now, the event $n$ trials result in $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures can happen in as many ways as $k$ letters $S$ can be distributed among $n$ places. In other words, our event contains ${n \\choose k}$ points, and, by definition, each point has the probability $p^k q^{n-k}$. This proves the\n",
