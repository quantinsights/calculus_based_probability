    "*Proof.* Arrange the pairs in a rectangular array in the form of a multiplication table with $m$ rows and $n$ columns so that $(a_j,b_k)$ stands at the intersection of the $j$th row and the $k$th column. Then, each pair appears once and only once, and the assertion becomes obvious. \n",

Each triple $(a_i,b_j,c_k)$ is itself a pair consisting of $(a_i,b_j)$ and an element $c_k$; the number of triplets is therefore $n_1 n_2 n_3$. Proceeding by induction, the assertion follows for every $r$. \n",

    "Perhaps the simplest and the most useful way of describing the last theorem is as follows. To form an $r$-tuplet $(a_{j_1},b_{j_2},\\ldots,x_{j_r})$ we have to choose one $a$, one $b$ etc. We have to perform $r$ selections in all and have in succession $n_1,n_2,\\ldots,n_r$ possibilities to choose from.

    "(b) In an agricultural experiment three different treatments are to be tested (for example, the application of a fertilizer, a spray and temperature).

    "(c) *Placing balls into cells* amounts to choosing one cell for each ball. With $r$ balls, we have $n$ choices for each ball, therefore $r$ balls can be placed in $n$ cells in $n^r$ different ways. For example, considering the faces of a die as cells, the experiment of throwing a die $r$ times has $6^r$ possible outcomes.\n",

    "(d) A set with $n$ elements has $2^n$ subsets including the empty set $\\emptyset$ and the set itself.

    "**Note.** (Labeling objects). Drawing a sample from a population is a very fundamental concept in statistics. It is important to think of the objects or people in the population as named or labeled. For example, if there are $n$ balls in a jar, we can imagine that they have labels from $1$ to $n$, even if the balls look the same to the human eye. In the birthday problem, we can give each person an ID (identification) number.\n",

Two populations are considered different if one contains an element not contained in the other. For example, the sets $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $\\{1,2\\}$ are different, because $\\{1,2\\}$ does not contain the element $3$. On the other hand, the set $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $\\{3,2,1\\}$ are identical populations. \n",

Note that, we don't distinguish between the subsets $\\{1,2\\}$ and $\\{2,1\\}$. The constitution of the jar is the same, as long as the elements in the jar are the same.
